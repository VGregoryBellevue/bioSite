            <h2>3D Printing & Miniature Painting</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite pastimes is 3D printing and painting miniature figures. Whether it's characters for tabletop games or custom designs, I love the process of creating intricate, detailed models. From designing to printing, and finally painting, each miniature is a work of art that brings my gaming adventures to life.</p>

            <p>My 3D printer has allowed me to build an extensive collection of mini figures that I use in various tabletop role-playing games. Painting these figures is a meditative process that adds a personal touch to each piece, making every gaming session that much more immersive.</p>

            <h2>Dungeon Mastering & Tabletop Role-Playing Games</h2>
            <p>Running Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and other tabletop RPGs is another big part of my life. As a Dungeon Master, I craft stories, build worlds, and guide players through epic adventures. I enjoy creating immersive experiences with detailed campaigns and hand-crafted settings, especially at my venue, the Bone Sack Speakeasy, where we host regular game nights.</p>

            <p>My passion for storytelling and creativity comes to life when I’m behind the screen. I love the collaboration between players, the unpredictability of dice rolls, and the feeling of bringing a world to life. It's not just about the game—it's about the shared experience and memories we create.</p>

            <br />

            <h2>Industrial Rock Enthusiast</h2>
            <p>When I'm not 3D printing or running games, I'm blasting industrial rock. Bands like Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, and Rammstein fuel my creativity and inspire the gritty, dark worlds I often explore in my RPG campaigns. The blend of electronic beats, distorted guitars, and powerful lyrics gives me the energy and inspiration I need to stay motivated in both my creative and professional endeavors.</p>

            <p>Music plays a huge role in setting the mood, not just in life but also in my D&D sessions. A well-curated industrial rock playlist can turn a regular game night into a dark, intense adventure.</p>
