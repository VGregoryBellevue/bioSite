            <p>I was born in the vibrant city of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The warmth of the tropical sun, the sound of coquíes, and the rich culture that surrounded me laid the foundation of who I would become.
My early years were filled with the sounds of salsa music echoing through the streets and the laughter of family gatherings a time I look back on with a sense of nostalgia for the beauty and energy
that Puerto Rico represents.</p>
            <br />
<p>But, like many families, we faced challenges, and my parents’ divorce brought a new chapter in my life. My mother and I moved to back her small, tranquil town of Coamo, nestled in the southern part 
of the island. Life in Coamo was different—quiet, with its own charm, yet filled with new adjustments. In the face of these changes, I learned the importance of resilience and adaptability, 
values that have stayed with me throughout my life.</p>

            <h2>My Teenage Years...</h2>
            <p>As a teenager, I returned to San Juan and enrolled at Dr. Juan J. Osuna High School. Here, I was reunited with the bustling energy of the city, and it became a formative time for me. High school wasn’t just about academics; it was a time to learn about myself, build friendships, and understand what I wanted from life. Through both successes and struggles, I found myself drawn to the world of technology and creativity—two things that would later define my career path.</p>
