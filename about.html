            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Matt Stetson, an entrepreneur and cider-maker currently living in St. Cloud, FL. My journey began in West Palm Beach, where I developed a deep passion for brewing and creating unique ciders. Over the years, I’ve built Accomplice, my award-winning company that has received accolades for its innovative flavors and quality brews. I moved to St. Cloud, where I continue to grow my businesses and make a positive impact on the local community.</p>
            <p>As someone who loves to bring people together, I’ve founded several businesses that thrive on community spirit. One of my favorite ventures is the Bone Sack Speakeasy, where people can come not only to enjoy great drinks but also to engage in board games and tabletop role-playing games.</p>

            <h2>My Early Years</h2>
            <p>I grew up fascinated by entrepreneurship, learning from my surroundings and constantly striving to find ways to innovate. From selling homemade cider to organizing events in my teenage years, I was always looking for ways to combine creativity with business. My teenage years were full of experiments and learning, which led to my first big venture in West Palm Beach.</p>

            <h2>The Start of Accomplice</h2>
            <p>Accomplice was born out of a desire to create unique, handcrafted ciders that people would remember. Starting small, I began experimenting with different flavors and brewing techniques. In just a few short years, I grew Accomplice into a recognized brand, winning numerous awards in Florida and beyond. Now, it continues to thrive here in St. Cloud, with a loyal community of customers who love quality, creativity, and innovation.</p>
            
            <h2>My Involvement in the Gaming Community</h2>
            <p>Apart from my passion for brewing, I'm an avid gamer. The Bone Sack Speakeasy allows me to combine my love for games with my entrepreneurial spirit. Hosting events for tabletop role-playing games (RPGs), such as Pirate Borg, is one of the ways I bring like-minded individuals together. I work closely with local game masters to create memorable, immersive experiences for our guests.</p>
